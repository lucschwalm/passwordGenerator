# Password Generator
This website randomly generates a password using math.random(), allowing the user to specify length and what type of characters to use.

# Usage 
Press the generate button and you will be prompted to enter a password length between 8-128 characters. Then, the page will prompt you if you want to include lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters (press ok for yes and cancel for no). You must choose at least one type of character to use. The password will then display in the center of the screen.
